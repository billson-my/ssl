What is a Multi-Domain Wildcard SSL Certificate?
A multi-domain wildcard SSL certificate is the perfect solution for situations where you need to secure multi-level subdomains. It allows encrypting multiple levels of subdomains with one certificate. Like the wildcard certificate, it can work whether the sites are on the same or separate servers.

----------



With a wildcard SSL certificate, the solution is a bit simpler. You can purchase 7 wildcard SSL certificates, to protect:

*.domain.com
*. blog.domain.com
*.preview.domain.com
*.project1.preview.domain.com
*.project2.preview.domain.com
*.project3.preview.domain.com
*.project4.preview.domain.com

That’s still a lot of certificates to purchase and manage. A multi-domain wildcard SSL certificate allows you to purchase a single SSL certificate, and add the above 7 sites as SANs (subject alternative names) to the SSL certificate. This allows you to save a lot of money and hassle by purchasing and installing a single SSL certificate.

Bottom line: If you have multiple levels of subdomains, a multi-domain wildcard SSL certificate is your best option!
